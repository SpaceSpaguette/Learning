Before remember that for them to be used you need define a variable.
any_text_that_is_together = "And a equal sign"

Python has few datatypes in which they can be used two different ways.
<font color="#c00000">int() integer</font>
<font color="#ffc000">str() string</font>
#### <font color="#92d050">bool() Boolean</font>                        
<font color="#0070c0">bin() Binary</font>
and many more

These things are used as a hard set for data types. We mostly use them in operations.
<font color="#0070c0">int is written as number </font>
<font color="#92d050">String can be defined like this </font>
```
"this is a string"
```

<font color="#245bdb">Bool uses either 1 or 0</font>
<font color="#245bdb">True</font>
<font color="#245bdb">False</font>

<font color="#d7e3bc">Different operations use different Data types as a value.</font>
so in our case <font color="#de7802">infinite loop</font> would be 
```
while true:
	print("Hello World")
```
this results in repeating Hello World

<font color="#00b0f0">But remember that anything below will not be executed</font>
