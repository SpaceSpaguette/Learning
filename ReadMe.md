**First**

This repository contains projects that I worked on over time. Most of the projects
will be updated slowly, but it's important to note that the code might not be optimized
or follow best practices. It's also possible that some projects may not be useful.
Please be aware that you may encounter errors when running the code. I will try to
provide information about what version or type of file each project uses.
