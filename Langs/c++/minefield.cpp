Yup at first i thought i was in python. Well to everyone's suprise.
this isn't python
// This isnt a popular opinion but i should have personal things here
// anyways we have 2 options. Either an array inside an array. Or super array.
// that brings is disaster becouse while we have an array we will have to calculate it 
// using more math. So its either x,y or +4 (The more math intensive option.)
// We will use second option since i already did use the first one in python.
